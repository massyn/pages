# Welcome to Our Blog!

We're excited to launch our new blog section! This demonstrates how Jekyll automatically handles blog posts when you place them in the `_posts` directory.

## How Blog Posts Work

Blog posts in Jekyll follow a specific naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. This post, for example, is named `2024-07-10-welcome-to-the-blog.md`.

### Features Include:

- **Automatic Listing**: Posts appear automatically on the blog index page
- **Date Sorting**: Posts are sorted by date (newest first)
- **Metadata Support**: Author, categories, and other metadata
- **Excerpts**: Automatic excerpt generation for the blog listing

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory
2. Name it with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`
3. Add front matter with title, date, and other metadata
4. Write your content in Markdown

The post will automatically appear in the blog index and be included in your site's navigation!
