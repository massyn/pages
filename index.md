# Welcome to GitHub Pages Demo

This is a demonstration of GitHub Pages with Jekyll, featuring:

- **Automatic Navigation**: The navigation menu is automatically generated from all pages in the site
- **Responsive Design**: The theme adapts to different screen sizes
- **Clean Layout**: Professional-looking design with gradient headers and card-style content
- **Easy to Extend**: Simply add new `.md` files with front matter to add new pages

## How It Works

The navigation system works by:
1. Scanning all pages in the site
2. Including pages that have a `title` in their front matter
3. Sorting them by `nav_order` (if specified)
4. Automatically generating the navigation menu

## Getting Started

To add a new page:
1. Create a new `.md` file
2. Add front matter with `layout: default` and `title: Your Page Title`
3. Optionally add `nav_order: number` to control menu order
4. Write your content in Markdown

The page will automatically appear in the navigation menu!
